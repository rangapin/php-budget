# php-budget

My Personal Finance is a pretty straight forward app based on a 1 to 1 database relationship.

Built with native PHP, the app allow a user to input various expenses and to filter them by day, month and year.

When managing expenses, the user can also delete any expenses if convenient.

All expenses are visible on the dashboard but the user also has access to various reports.

Due to a rather short time frame, the features are looking to be improved, for instance:

- The easypie charts does not actually represent the number that it indicates, it always fill up completely.

- Improvement can me made on the responsiveness

- There are probably too many forms to fill in here and these should be removed if possible.

- A new filter for type of expense instead of date would be relevant

& also there is terrible lack of icons in this project, and this is troubling me.
